# Project-CryptoSym

This is a project for my engineering school (ESILV, Fintech specialty) which aims to improve our development skills.

The objective of this project is to store securely a password in a database with hashing and encryption technology. We need to let the owner with the correct password be able to log in while preventing a hacker from being able to log in even after a database leak.
